Events:-
An event is an action or occurrence recognized by a software. To make an event more clear let's use the daily activities we do when we use a computer such as clicking on a button, hover on an image, pressing a keyboard, scrolling the mouse wheel and etc.

Handling events in React is very similar to handling elements on DOM elements using pure JavaScript. Some of the syntax difference between handling event in React and pure JavaScript:

.React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
.With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
