/**
 * 6. Scope:-
   Variable is the fundamental part in programming. We declare variable to store different data types. To declare a variable we use the key word var, let and const. A variable can declared at different scope. In this section we will see the scope, scope of variables when we use var or let. Variables scopes can be:

    Window
    Global
    Local
    Variable can be declared globally or locally or window scope. We will see both global and local scope. Anything declared without let, var or const is scoped at window level.

/**
 * Window Scope:- Without using console.log() open your browser and check, you will see the value of a and b if you write a or b on the browser. That means a and b are already available in the window.
